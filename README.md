Done by: Sen Ivan, Viktor Paholok and Lidiia Semsichko

## Description
In this repo we have a program that leverages NVIDIA CUDA technology, to accelerate
compuration of numerical integration of a function. The function is defined in the
`integrate.cu` file. The program is able to compute the integral of a function
using the trapezoidal rule.
This is project for the course "Architecture of computer systems" at the Ukranian Catholic University.
